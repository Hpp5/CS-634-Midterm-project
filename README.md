# CS-634-Midterm-project
1. Create 10 items usually seen in Amazon, K-mart, or any 
other supermarkets (e.g. diapers, clothes, etc.). 
2. Create a database of 20 transactions each containing 
some of these items. Save the transaction in a CSV file.  
 
3. Repeat (1) by creating 4 additional, different databases each 
containing 20 transactions. 
4. Note: You can create these transactions and datasets manually, 
download them from the net, or use the examples I will provide. In 
any case, add a note to your report where and how you built your data 
sets. 
 Using the Apriori algorithm, generate and print out all the association rules 
and the input transactions for each of the 5 transactional databases you 
created/used. The support and confidence must be user-specified 
parameters, so the output should show different rules with respect to 
different databases and different support/confidence.  
Make sure to show multiple support and confidence results. 
The items and transactions must be clear and easy to identify.
